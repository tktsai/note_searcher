# note-searcher

Full-text and tag-based searching of arbitrary directories and files.
Lets you make your own zettelkasten! Inspired by https://zettelkasten.de/.

This extension requires Java. It's been tested with OpenJDK 11 on windows, and
may work on [OpenJDK 13](https://jdk.java.net/13/) on all OS's!


## How to use this extension

![extension screenshot](https://github.com/uozuAho/note_searcher/blob/master/vscode/img/ext_screenshot.png)

When active, this extension indexes all .md, .txt and .log files in the
currently open folder. As you are modifying a file, the extension window will
show a list of files related to the current file, based on keywords and tags
extracted from the current file.

You can also search for files by pressing ctrl+alt+s. Some example queries:

```
apple banana +carrot  # file contains the word carrot, and possibly apple or banana
apple banana -carrot  # file does not contain carrot, but either apple and/or banana
apple banana #food    # file contains apple, banana, and/or the tag #food
```

Any word starting with a '#' character is considered a tag, allowing for
tag-based searching.

Note that with VS Code, you can add links to local files using markdown
syntax. These become hyperlinks to your local files! Examples:

- `[](file/relative/to/current/dir)`
- `[](/file/relative/to/currently/open/dir/in/vscode)`
