# Note searcher demo directory

Open this directory with note seacher to test its features.


## full text search

Press `ctrl+alt+s` to search for files using full-text search. Some example
queries:

`cheese`
`cheese -food`
`cheese +train`


## tags

You can also put tags anywhere in your files, #weapons or #public-speaking.
These are also searchable:

`cheese +#transport`


## links

Add a [link](trains.md) to your files, and vscode makes them clickable
hyperlinks. Files can be images or other non-text files, eg.
[not a note](not_a_note.bin)
