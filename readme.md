# Notes searcher

Full-text and tag-based searching of arbitrary directories and files.
Lets you make your own zettelkasten! Inspired by https://zettelkasten.de/.

Runs in VS code as an extension.


# projects

See each project dir for detailed docs. To build the whole lot:

> ./build.all.sh

This will build a vscode extension (vsix) in this directory, which
you can install from vscode.

## vscode

VS code extension

## cli

Console app that does indexing and searching


# todo
- auto-index
    - on save file
    - on open directory
- bug: ext does not activate on open note searcher
    - workaround: do a search or index to activate
- show view container on search complete
- suggest tags
- bug: '+' operator not working as expected:
    - search for #work: no results
    - search for book: many results
    - search for +#work book:
        - expected: no results
        - actual:   many results
- search box in results view (not supported in tree view... use webview?)
