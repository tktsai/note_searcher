- feature: extract text to new note
- feature: show recent notes
- feature: show random notes
- show view container on search complete, even if no search results
- choose search engine:
    - lunr:   pros: no deps, simple implementation
              cons: slow, no incremental index (must rebuild from scratch)
    - lucene: pros: fast, powerful
              cons: needs java, complex impl (compared to lunr)
- e2e test throws unhandled promise rejection after test completes
- support wiki-style links, with id only (for archive users)
- docs
    - get readme working in extension preview in vscode
    - make screenshot show in extension preview
    - prevent github link replacement in example file links
- lucene search bug: '+' operator not working as expected:
    - using lucene
    - search for #work: no results
    - search for book: many results
    - search for +#work book:
        - expected: no results
        - actual:   many results
- separate view for search results + related files etc.
    - I want to see file tree at same time
    - search box in results view. not supported in tree view
- dead links: strip root path when showing dead links
- highlight dead links while editing
