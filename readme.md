# Notes searcher

Full-text and tag-based searching of arbitrary directories and files.
Lets you make your own zettelkasten! Inspired by https://zettelkasten.de/.

Runs in VS code as an extension.


# projects

See each project dir for detailed docs. To build the whole lot:

> ./build.all.sh

This will build a vscode extension (vsix) in this directory, which
you can install from vscode.
