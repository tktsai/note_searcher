# Notes searcher

VS code extension for managing a collection of local text files, eg. a
[zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/).

Features:
- full text search
- search by tags
- shortcuts for creating and linking notes

See the [extension marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=uozuaho.note-searcher) for more details.

## Requirements

- nodejs


## Run tests

```sh
cd vscode
npm install
npm test
npm run e2e:setup
./run_e2e.sh
```

e2e tests use https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-extension-tester

Note that the vscode version used for tests may be outdated. It is fixed at a
particular version since using the latest version tends to break UI tests when
it is released. Ideally I'd have it set to the latest version - 1.


## Run the extension locally

Open the vscode directory with VS code, and run the `Run Extension`
configuration.


## Build the extension locally

Run `npm run build_vsix` in the vscode directory.
